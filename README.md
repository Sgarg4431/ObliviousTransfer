# Oblivious Transfer 

- The OT in its basic form, is used for exchanging information between 2 parties without revealing the knowledge of what data was exchanged

- Alice has two messages for Bob. But Alice allows reading only one message to Bob. Also, Bob does not like let know Alice, which message he read. Oblivious Transfer allows you to solve this kind of problems

- Oblivious transfer is the base concept behind the zero-knowledge proof.

- This repository contains three files (OT,OT using Treazor's lib,OT using OblivC lib).




## Files

- This repo consists of three files namely - OT, OT using Trezor's lib, OT using OblivC lib
- OT file consists of basic implementaion of Oblivious transfer protocol without using point add and point multiply functions
- OT using Trezor's file consists of implementaion of Oblivious transfer protocol with using point add and point multiply functions from trezor's library
- OT using oblivC lib file consists of implementaion using the oblivC lib written in c )
